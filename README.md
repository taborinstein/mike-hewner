## Ode to Buffalo, the Code Whisperer

In halls where circuits softly hum,
And syntax dances on each thumb,
There dwells a sage, both wise and keen—
Dr. Mike Hewner, coding dean.
But students know him by a name
That bucks the norm, that stakes his claim—
"Buffalo," with spirit bold,
A heart of fire, a mind of gold.
He strides into the lecture hall
Where whiteboard scrawls and coffee call,
With tales of Scheme, both crisp and bright,
And C's bare bones, low-level might.
"Now look," he says, with knowing grin,
"Where Racket ends, does C begin?"
One built with guardrails, smooth and clean,
The other raw, a hacker’s dream.
In Racket’s world, the lambdas play,
And recursion reigns by night and day.
It’s elegance, he’ll oft declare,
While C just shrugs and strips it bare.
Yet Buffalo sees more than code—
He maps the paths that thought has strode.
He teaches minds not just to build,
But to be curious, sharp, and skilled.
His chalk dust wisdom gently floats,
Like semicolons in love notes.
And though the bugs may bite and cling,
He shows us joy in debugging.
So here’s to you, O Buffalo,
Wherever classroom breezes blow—
May Scheme be sweet, and pointers kind,
And segfaults few, for those you’ve mined.
A guide, a mentor, never terse,
The cowboy in the universe—
Where functions nest and brackets gleam—
Long live the doctor of the dream.
